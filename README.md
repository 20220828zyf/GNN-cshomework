# Graph Convolutional Networks

This is a TensorFlow implementation of Graph Convolutional Networks for the task of (semi-supervised) classification of nodes in a graph, as described in the paper:
 
Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) (ICLR 2017)


## Requirements
Look at requirement.txt

## Run the demo

```bash
cd src/gcn
python train.py --dataset cora
```

## Data

In order to use your own data, you have to provide 
* an N by N adjacency matrix (N is the number of nodes), 
* an N by D feature matrix (D is the number of features per node), and
* an N by E binary label matrix (E is the number of classes).

Have a look at the `load_data()` function in `utils.py` for an example.

## Models

You can choose between the following models: 
* `gcn`: Graph convolutional network (Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907), 2016)
* `gcn_cheby`: Chebyshev polynomial version of graph convolutional network as described in (Michaël Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, Pierre Vandergheynst, [Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), NIPS 2016)
